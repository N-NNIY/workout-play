# Workout Video Trainer

A web app to automate your workout video playlists, so you can focus on moving without distractions.

## 💡 Motivation

I often found it frustrating to manually switch between workout videos and track rest/stretch times. This tool solves that by automating the entire video flow.

## 🚀 Features

- Set custom play durations and rest/stretch intervals
- Automatic video switching
- Countdown animations and sound reminders
- Workout summary at the end (total sets, duration)
- Local storage support for saving playlists
- Fully responsive design (mobile & desktop)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React
- Zustand for state management
- react-player for video playback
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations

## 🌟 Challenges

- Controlling video transitions seamlessly
- Designing an intuitive playlist editor
